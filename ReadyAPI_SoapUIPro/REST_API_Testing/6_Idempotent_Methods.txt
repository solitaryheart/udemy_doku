The method os called idempotent wehen, even after calling
same method repeatedly should NOT RESULT in changing
the resource state


the HTTP Status code can change -> but the resource ITSELF
keeps in the same resource state

POST -> not idempotent methods -> if no constraints are implementent new data will be created
PUT -> no change in the data, after sending same request -> idempotent
GET - > no change in the data, after sending same request -> idempotent
DELETE -> no change in the data, after sending same request -> idempotent


first invoke can change the data, but not the second or third request !
