Add Gherkin syntax-highlighting in notepad++ (select menu: languages-> gherkin)
before - >impert Gherkin.xml file

GENERAL APPROACH

a) Write Feature File - English (Gherkin)
b) Write Step Definitions - Actual Automation code (Groovy)
c) Execute Test Case


1.) Feature = Test Suite | Test Scenario (.feature)

- can have multiple test cases (test case = scenario)
- each test case can have multiple tests
- feature file is supposed to describe a single feature of the system
- when we write a feature, we are writing a scenario which is going to have multiple tests


-Syntax
----------------------------------------
Feature: Login Functionality
		Here we will test login by admin, super admin, guest and customers

------------------------------------------------------------

2.) Scenario = Test Cases

- a scenario can be defined as a single acceptance test case
- each future can have multiple scenario


-Syntax

------------------------------------------
Scenario: Login by customer
		

Scenario: Login by Guest User


Scenario: Login by Super Admin
----------------------------------------------

3.) Gherkin-Given Step

- steps are part of each scenario (test case)
- step typically starts with Given, When or Then
- we can also user And or But
- given steps are used to describe the initial context of the system
- normallly given is used for configuring the system
- such as creating and configuring objects or adding data to the database
- starting browser and enter URL
- it's okay to have several Given Steps (just use And or But for number 2 and 
  upwards to make it more readable


-Syntax

------------------------------------------
Scenario: Login by customer
		  Given User is on Login page
		

Scenario: Login by Guest User
		   Given User open browser
		   And Enter url
----------------------------------------------

4.) When & Then Step

- When steps are used to describe an event or an action
- Then steps are use to describe an expected outcome, or result

- Syntax (When with multiple steps - Then)
---------------------------------------------

Scenario: Login by customer
		  Given User is on Login page
		  When user enter username
		  And User enter password
		  And Click on Login Button
		  Then User should be logged in successfully
		

Scenario: Login by Guest User
		   Given User open browser
		   And Enter url
		   When User click on Guest user link
		   And User enter email id
		   And click on Submit
		   Then User should be logged in as a Guest user

-----------------------------------------------

5.) Background (Keyword)

- we will face some situation when we have same repitive Given steps in all
  of the scenarios in a feature file
- since it is repeated in every scenario it is an indication that those
  steps are not essential to describe the scenaios
- we can move such Given steps to the background by grouping them under 
  a background section before the first scenario

Syntax

------------------------------

Feature: Login Functionality
		Here we will test login by admin, super admin, guest and customers

Background: Given User is on Login page
		
Scenario: Login by customer
		  When user enter username
		  And User enter password
		  And Click on Login Button
		  Then User should be logged in successfully

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.) Gherkin: Step Argument

- in some cases you might want to pass a test data from feature file,
  in this case we are going to use step argument
- step argument are written in "data"

Syntax

---------------------------------------

Scenario: Login by Super Admin
          Given User is on Login page
	  When user enter username "testing"
	  And  user enter password "abc"
          And click on Login Button
          Then User logged in successfully


------------------------------------------

6.) Gherkin: Scenario outline + Examples

- when we want to implement data driven scenario with multipe input
 and in case of each input we are expectin a different output, int
 that kind on scenario wer are using scenario outline kexword
- Scenario has to start with "Scenario Outline" keyword
- data-driven data shound be placed in "<>"
- Data place in "Examples" keyword
- a scenario outline section is always followd by one or more example section,
  which are a container for a table
- the table must have a header row corresponding to the variables in the scenario
 outline steps
- each of the rows below will creare a new scenario, filling in the variable values

Syntax
------------------------------------------

Scenario Outline: Login by customer
		  Given User is on Login page
		  When user enter username <username>
		  And User enter password <password>
		  And click on signin button
		  Then User should be logged in successfully
		  
		  Examples:
			| username | password |
			| testing | abc@123 |
			| testing1 | abc1234 |
			| testing2 | abc@12345 |

---------------------------------------------

7.) Gherkin: Comments & Tags

a) comments
# to tell cucumber that the remainer of the line is a comment
ans shouldn't be executed

b) tags
 - tags are a way to group scenarios
-  they are @-prefixed strings and you can place as many tags as you like above
   feature, scenario, scenario outline an examples keywords

Syntax
-----------------------------

Regression		
Scenario Outline: Login by customer
		  Given User is on Login page
		  When user enter username <username>
		  And User enter password <password>
		  And click on signin button
		  Then User should be logged in successfully
		  
		  Examples:
			| username | password |
			| testing | abc@123 |
			| testing1 | abc1234 |
			| testing2 | abc@12345 |
